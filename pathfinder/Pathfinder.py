'''
The Pathfinder class is responsible for finding a solution (i.e., a
sequence of actions) that takes the agent from the initial state to the
optimal goal state.

This task is done in the Pathfinder.solve method, as parameterized
by a maze pathfinding problem, and is aided by the SearchTreeNode DS.
